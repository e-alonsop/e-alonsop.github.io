I am always eager to collaborate with interesting research or new projects in the following fields:
* Social determinants of health
* Quantitative intersectionality
* Social stratification of sleep health inequalities

## 1. Einstein Center Population Diversity (ECPD)

My research position is funded under the [Einstein Center Population Diversity](https://medizinsoziologie-reha-wissenschaft.charite.de/en/research/aging_research/einstein_center_population_diversity/) (ECPD). The ECPD is an interdisciplinary collaborative research center based in Berlin. Its main aim is to study the consequences of increasing population diversity for social inequality and health disparities by focusing on the growing diversity of families, including changing conceptions and boundaries of the family itself. 

Demographic changes such as growing longevity and increasing family diversity play key roles in shaping our current and future societies. While seen as an opportunity, diversity also entails potential risks of inequalities such as segregation, social exclusion, or disparities in health and education. It is necessary to cooperate in a consortium of research institutions, with an intersectional and interdisciplinary approach on how demographic and family diversity can affect critical dimensions of social and health inequality. Given the societal relevance of understanding the interrelations of family and population diversity in the key outcomes of education, economic welfare and health from a life course perspective, the ECPD pursues the following three overarching research ambitions:

1. To assess the implications of growing population and family diversity for social and health inequalities and to identify promising targets and approaches for intervention
2. To advance our understanding of social and health inequalities through the integration of biomedical and social science
3. To capture the social and health consequences of current and potential future global crises and changes for individuals, families and societies

The ECPD firmly establishes social demography in Berlin and Germany. It promotes a broader conceptual understanding of how health research, including aging, disability, mobility, and mortality as well as biological or epigenetic perspectives can enrich social science and vice versa. By linking the two strands of research, the ECPD overcomes disciplinary fragmentation and moves toward a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of how social and health inequalities are shaped through ongoing (mega)trends and their interaction with the family sphere, thus creating a scientific basis for tackling the paramount societal challenges ahead of us.

## 2. An Intersectional Perspective on Physiological Risk Biomarkers of Age-related Non-Communicable Diseases

The use of biomarkers allows the assessment of biological risk, which is of interest to investigate physiological pathways through which sociodemographic variables can affect healthy ageing. However, most quantitative studies have not taken an intersectional perspective on social determinants of healthy ageing and related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Instead, they rather focused on the sole impact and interactions of certain demographic or socioeconomic characteristics. Within the present study, we aim to bridge social and biomedical research by applying quantitative intersectionality. This innovative technique will enable us to explore intersectional disparities in risk biomarkers for CVD, T2DM and CKD in German older adults.

We exploit secondary data from the [NAKO National Cohort](https://nako.de/informationen-auf-englisch/) in Germany, with rich biomarker and sociodemographic data of more than 200,000 randomly selected citizens aged 20-69 across all Germany.
