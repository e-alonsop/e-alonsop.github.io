  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper analyzes the effects of future-oriented caregiving and employment uncertainties on fertility intentions in Germany. The impact of uncertainty on fertility intentions has been widely explored in the literature, with a strong focus on past and current experiences of adverse economic conditions. There is limited research on the effects of uncertainty in other domains (e.g. caregiving responsibilities) and possible interactive effects of multiple types of future-oriented uncertainty. Using a vignette experiment from the nationally representative German Socio- Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) (n=1,750), respondents were randomly exposed to a hypothetical couple’s future caregiving and employment uncertainties, each with four possible levels, and subsequently evaluated their fertility intentions in the short-run. Having no female caregiving responsibilities and no employment uncertainty for both partners in the foreseeable future increases fertility intentions by 2.8 and 1.9 units, respectively, on a 0-10 scale, relative to when future uncertainties are high. While there are gendered differences in the effect of caregiving uncertainty, the effect of employment uncertainty is not moderated by any of the respondents’ own employment characteristics. Respondent-assessed fertility intentions are highest when there are no future caregiving responsibilities and both partners are in secure employment. This paper highlights individual perceptions of the enabling conditions for initiating parenthood and how caregiving responsibilities and employment instability translate to concerns about family formation in aging societies.

Molina, S., **Alonso-Perez, E.**, Kreyenfeld, M. Divorce and Mental Health: Analysis at the Intersection of Age, Gender, and Income.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines how divorce relates to mental health, and how this association is stratified by gender, age, and individual income. Data is drawn from German register data, which includes marital histories of divorcees and diagnosed health outcomes. The analytical sample includes persons aged 30-59 in 2015 (n=23,426,639). We employ a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) in which the outcome variable is the annual incidence of mental disease diagnosis to compare the patterns of the newly divorced (divorced for less than four years) to the patterns of the never divorced. The analysis helps to identify high-risk populations along the age-gender-income spectrum. Compared to the never divorced, we find a very strong age gradient among newly divorced women. While age seems to be a general risk factor, the small group of women with a very high income face a relatively low risk of receiving a mental disease diagnosis. Among men, older and low-income males are at particularly high risk of being diagnosed with a mental disease.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Objectives: Discrimination poses a threat to the mental health of university students, especially those affected by social inequality, yet understanding its intersectional impact remains limited. This study examines the intersection of social inequalities with perceived discrimination to explore differences in mental health among students in Germany. Intersectionality and Student Mental Health
Methods: Data from the cross-sectional project "Study Conditions and Mental Health of University Students" (n = 14,592) were analysed using Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA). Depressive symptoms, cognitive stress symptoms, and exhaustion were examined across 48 intersectional strata based on gender, first academic generation, family care tasks, and perceived discrimination.
Results: The MAIHDA analysis revealed substantial between strata variance, with most of it explained by additive rather than intersectional interaction effects. Perceived discrimination, diverse or female gender, first academic generation, and family care tasks (for exhaustion only) were negatively associated with mental health outcomes. 
Conclusions: The profound associations between perceived discrimination and the mental health among university students call for urgent attention and intervention within university settings. Adopting an intersectional lens is key to identifying and addressing inequalities.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Sleep plays a pivotal role in overall health and wellbeing, also serving as a key indicator of social status and privilege. The prevalence of sleep problems is unevenly distributed within societies, where individual social determinants of sleep are embedded within larger social contexts (e.g., neighborhood deprivation). Incorporating intersectionality is needed to address structural inequalities in sleep that reflect the lived social realities beyond the individual-level. Our sample consisted on 17,008 individuals aged 50 and older from waves 4 and 5 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We created 72 unique intersectional strata by interacting individual axes of social inequality (sex/gender, family caregiving, education, occupation) with perceived neighborhood deprivation. To investigate the variations in sleep disturbances across intersectional strata, we employed Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA). Intersectional strata explained 8.48% of the variance in sleep disturbances, with the most vulnerable groups (i.e., women doing family caregiving, with low education, blue-collar occupations and living in highly-deprived neighborhoods) displaying the most sleep disturbances. Sex/gender and neighborhood deprivation were the main predictors of such differences. Although we found some multiplicative effects, most differences in sleep disturbances were driven by additive effects. Given the importance of sleep for health and the growing social inequalities, intersectionality is as a useful tool to map and decompose sleep disparities. Interventions should go beyond the individual-level and include measures at the neighborhood-level to promote sleep equity. Tailored prevention actions should target socially vulnerable groups, especially women living in deprived neighborhoods.
