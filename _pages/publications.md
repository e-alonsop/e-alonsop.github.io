Ramos, V. J., Kreyenfeld, M., **Alonso-Perez, E.**, Gellert, P., Heisig, J. P., O'Sullivan, J. L. Fertility Intentions Under Future Caregiving and Employment Uncertainties: Experimental Evidence from Germany. _(R&R)_.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper analyzes the effects of future-oriented caregiving and employment uncertainties on fertility intentions in Germany. The impact of uncertainty on fertility intentions has been widely explored in the literature, with a strong focus on past and current experiences of adverse economic conditions. There is limited research on the effects of uncertainty in other domains (e.g. caregiving responsibilities) and possible interactive effects of multiple types of future-oriented uncertainty. Using a vignette experiment from the nationally representative German Socio- Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) (n=1,750), respondents were randomly exposed to a hypothetical couple’s future caregiving and employment uncertainties, each with four possible levels, and subsequently evaluated their fertility intentions in the short-run. Having no female caregiving responsibilities and no employment uncertainty for both partners in the foreseeable future increases fertility intentions by 2.8 and 1.9 units, respectively, on a 0-10 scale, relative to when future uncertainties are high. While there are gendered differences in the effect of caregiving uncertainty, the effect of employment uncertainty is not moderated by any of the respondents’ own employment characteristics. Respondent-assessed fertility intentions are highest when there are no future caregiving responsibilities and both partners are in secure employment. This paper highlights individual perceptions of the enabling conditions for initiating parenthood and how caregiving responsibilities and employment instability translate to concerns about family formation in aging societies.

Molina, S., **Alonso-Perez, E.**, Kreyenfeld, M. Divorce and Mental Health: Analysis at the Intersection of Age, Gender, and Income.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines how divorce relates to mental health, and how this association is stratified by gender, age, and individual income. Data is drawn from German register data, which includes marital histories of divorcees and diagnosed health outcomes. The analytical sample includes persons aged 30-59 in 2015 (n=23,426,639). We employ a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) in which the outcome variable is the annual incidence of mental disease diagnosis to compare the patterns of the newly divorced (divorced for less than four years) to the patterns of the never divorced. The analysis helps to identify high-risk populations along the age-gender-income spectrum. Compared to the never divorced, we find a very strong age gradient among newly divorced women. While age seems to be a general risk factor, the small group of women with a very high income face a relatively low risk of receiving a mental disease diagnosis. Among men, older and low-income males are at particularly high risk of being diagnosed with a mental disease.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Out-of-home mobility and social participation have been identified as resources to postpone frailty. We aim to examine the specific contribution of social out-of-home activities for preventing and reducing frailty. Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) waves six (w6), seven (w7), and eight (w8) were used. Frailty was measured with the SHARE version of the Edmonton Frail-Scale (EFS) with frailty states robust, pre-fail and frail. First, a mediation model with 13,456 robust participants aged ≥ 50 years in w6 was specified with social network size, loneliness (3-Item UCLA loneliness scale), and lack of motivation (EURO-D) as predictors and number of performed social out-of-home activities in w7 as mediator variable on EFS-scores in w8. Age, education, gender, and cohabitation served as covariates. Second, we investigated the association of increasing social out-of-home activities from w6 to w7 with change in EFS-score in w8 using a linear mixed model with 17,439 participants in all frailty states. Direct effects of loneliness (w6) and lack of motivation (w6) on EFS-scores (w8) were partially mediated by social out-of-home activities (loneliness ß=.01; CI 95%=.01 to .02) and (lack of motivation ß=.02; CI 95%=.02 to .03). The linear mixed model revealed a significant effect of increasing social out-of-home activities (w6 to w7) on reduction of EFS-scores (w8) (ß=-.21; CI 95%= -.29 to .14; p<.001). Social out-of-home activities appear to play a crucial role in frailty prevention, which could be used for future interventions.

Lech, S., Köppe, M., Berger, M., **Alonso-Perez, E.**, Gellert, P., Buspavanich, P., Herrmann, W. Depressive symptoms among individuals identifying as asexual during the COVID-19 pandemic – a cross-sectional study.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Although asexuality became a growing research subject over the last decade, data on the mental health of individuals identifying as asexual is still rare. The key objective of the present study was to examine depressive symptoms among individuals identifying as asexual during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data of LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Trans*, Queer, Inter*, Asexual and/or + indicating others within the community) and cis-heterosexual individuals was collected through an online survey during the first (March/April 2020) and the second (January/February 2021) COVID-19 lockdowns in Germany. The survey included questions about sexual and gender identity, depressive symptoms, and asexual identity. Descriptive and regression analysis of N = 6601 participants was conducted. A total of n = 445 individuals identified as asexual. Comparison of means showed that individuals identifying as asexual reported significantly higher depressive symptoms (M = 4.15;47 SD = 1.18) than allosexual individuals (M = 3.53; SD = 1.25) (T (5925) = 9.85, p < .001, 48 95% CI [0.50; 0.74]). Further, regression results indicate identifying as asexual to be significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms compared to identifying as allosexual. The results of this study suggest that individuals identifying as asexual represent a vulnerable group within the group of sexual minorities, one that fundamentally requires special psychosocial support, especially in times of pandemics. A greater attention to the spectrum of asexuality in research and in healthcare provision is of great importance, especially in times of crisis.

**Alonso-Perez, E.**, Schnitzer, S., O'Sullivan, J. L., Gellert, P. Intersectional effects in the onset of caregiving: An intra- and intergenerational Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) using European longitudinal data.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Family old age care is a central part of many people's lives in aging societies. The point in a person’s life course at which this caregiving begins has a decisive influence on the health, social and employment development of the caregivers. However, when this onset of caregiving occurs and whether it occurs socially and intersectionally stratified has only been insufficiently investigated. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we included adults who became intragenerational (i.e., partner, siblings) or intergenerational (i.e., parents, in-laws) informal caregivers between waves 1 and 8 (ages 50-95). We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to determine the degree of intersectionality in the age of caregiving onset, separately for intra- and intergenerational caregiving (> once per month, either outside or in the household). The combinations of sex/gender, migration background, education and occupation were used to create 48 unique intersectional strata. Intragenerational care (N = 10,495) onset was at 69.46 years on average, with over 10 years of difference between strata. Intersectional strata explained a substantial amount of variation in the age of onset (VPC=6.64%), and up to 26% of these differences were explained by interaction effects. Intergenerational care (N=12,860) onset was at 58.52 years on average, with a difference of almost 6 years between strata. Most variation was due to main effects only, with modest intersectional interaction effects. For both the intra- and intergenerational models the combinations of female sex/gender, low skill occupation and high education were associated with an earlier onset of caregiving. We found clear differences in age of caregiving onset between intersectional strata both in intra- and intergenerational care, with presence of interaction effects in the intragenerational case only. While female sex/gender and low skill occupations were related to an earlier onset, low education was related to a later onset, especially at their intersections. The intersectional nature of caregiving onset within the life course is critical to further understand the prerequisites, meaning and consequences for care providers.

**Alonso-Perez, E.**, Gellert, P., O'Sullivan, J. L. The Privilege of Good Sleep? How critical intersections of Social Inequalities and Neighborhood Context impact Sleep Health Disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Sleep health is unevenly distributed across population subgroups. Previous research has focused on social determinants of sleep both at the individual and social-context level, but further evidence is needed regarding the intersectionality of these aspects together. We investigate sleep health disparities through the social-ecological model of sleep health and an intersectional lens, incorporating social determinants of sleep for individuals embedded in their neighborhood context. We exploited data from 26,850 individuals aged 50 and older from Waves 4 and 5 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Neighborhood-level characteristics were interacted with individual axes of social inequalities to create 96 unique intersectional strata. We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to explore variations in sleep disturbances across intersectional strata. Intersectional strata explained 9.01% of variance in sleep disturbances, with the most socially vulnerable groups (i.e., women with migration background, low SES and living in disadvantaged neighborhoods) displaying the most sleep disturbances. Sex/gender and neighborhood context were the main predictors of such differences. Although we found some multiplicative effects, most sleep health disparities were driven by additive main effects. Given the importance of sleep health and the growing social inequalities, intersectionality is as a useful tool to map and decompose sleep disparities. Interventions should go beyond the individual-level and include neighborhood-level measures to promote sleep equity and improve health outcomes. Tailored prevention actions should target socially disadvantaged groups, especially women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
