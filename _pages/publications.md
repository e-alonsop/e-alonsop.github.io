  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This paper analyzes the effects of future-oriented caregiving and employment uncertainties on fertility intentions in Germany. The impact of uncertainty on fertility intentions has been widely explored in the literature, with a strong focus on past and current experiences of adverse economic conditions. There is limited research on the effects of uncertainty in other domains (e.g. caregiving responsibilities) and possible interactive effects of multiple types of future-oriented uncertainty. Using a vignette experiment from the nationally representative German Socio- Economic Panel Innovation Sample (SOEP-IS) (n=1,750), respondents were randomly exposed to a hypothetical couple’s future caregiving and employment uncertainties, each with four possible levels, and subsequently evaluated their fertility intentions in the short-run. Having no female caregiving responsibilities and no employment uncertainty for both partners in the foreseeable future increases fertility intentions by 2.8 and 1.9 units, respectively, on a 0-10 scale, relative to when future uncertainties are high. While there are gendered differences in the effect of caregiving uncertainty, the effect of employment uncertainty is not moderated by any of the respondents’ own employment characteristics. Respondent-assessed fertility intentions are highest when there are no future caregiving responsibilities and both partners are in secure employment. This paper highlights individual perceptions of the enabling conditions for initiating parenthood and how caregiving responsibilities and employment instability translate to concerns about family formation in aging societies.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines how divorce relates to mental health, and how this association is stratified by gender, age, and individual income. Data is drawn from German register data, which includes marital histories of divorcees and diagnosed health outcomes. The analytical sample includes persons aged 30-59 in 2015 (n=23,426,639). We employ a Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) in which the outcome variable is the annual incidence of mental disease diagnosis to compare the patterns of the newly divorced (divorced for less than four years) to the patterns of the never divorced. The analysis helps to identify high-risk populations along the age-gender-income spectrum. Compared to the never divorced, we find a very strong age gradient among newly divorced women. While age seems to be a general risk factor, the small group of women with a very high income face a relatively low risk of receiving a mental disease diagnosis. Among men, older and low-income males are at particularly high risk of being diagnosed with a mental disease.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Out-of-home mobility and social participation have been identified as resources to postpone frailty. We aim to examine the specific contribution of social out-of-home activities for preventing and reducing frailty. Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) waves six (w6), seven (w7), and eight (w8) were used. Frailty was measured with the SHARE version of the Edmonton Frail-Scale (EFS) with frailty states robust, pre-fail and frail. First, a mediation model with 13,456 robust participants aged ≥ 50 years in w6 was specified with social network size, loneliness (3-Item UCLA loneliness scale), and lack of motivation (EURO-D) as predictors and number of performed social out-of-home activities in w7 as mediator variable on EFS-scores in w8. Age, education, gender, and cohabitation served as covariates. Second, we investigated the association of increasing social out-of-home activities from w6 to w7 with change in EFS-score in w8 using a linear mixed model with 17,439 participants in all frailty states. Direct effects of loneliness (w6) and lack of motivation (w6) on EFS-scores (w8) were partially mediated by social out-of-home activities (loneliness ß=.01; CI 95%=.01 to .02) and (lack of motivation ß=.02; CI 95%=.02 to .03). The linear mixed model revealed a significant effect of increasing social out-of-home activities (w6 to w7) on reduction of EFS-scores (w8) (ß=-.21; CI 95%= -.29 to .14; p<.001). Social out-of-home activities appear to play a crucial role in frailty prevention, which could be used for future interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Caregiving for older relatives is central for many people's lives in aging societies. The timing of caregiving onset significantly influences caregivers' health, social, and employment trajectories. However, the age at which family caregiving begins and its potential social and intersectional stratification have not been sufficiently explored. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we analysed individuals becoming daily caregivers between waves 1 and 9 (ages 50-95). We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to determine intersectional inequalities in the age of caregiving onset, separately for intragenerational (partner, siblings) and intergenerational (parents, in-laws) caregiving. We created 48 intersectional strata with combinations of sex/gender, migration background, education, and occupation. Intragenerational care onset was at 70.18 years on average (N = 10,146), with 11 years of difference between strata. Intersectional strata explained substantial variation in onset age (VPC = 7.14%), and 10% of these differences were due to intersectional interaction effects. Intergenerational care (N = 3,966) began earlier at 59.56 years on average, with a difference of over 4 years between strata. Most between-strata variation was additive. For both intra- and intergenerational care, combinations of women with low-skill occupations and high education were associated with earlier caregiving onset. We found large differences in the age of caregiving onset between intersectional strata in both intra- and intergenerational care. Mapping social heterogeneity and the intersectional nature of caregiving onset within the life-course is critical to further understand the prerequisites, meaning, and consequences for family caregivers.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Sleep plays a pivotal role in overall health and wellbeing, also serving as a key indicator of social status and privilege. The prevalence of sleep problems is unevenly distributed within societies, where individual social determinants of sleep are embedded within larger social contexts (e.g., neighborhood deprivation). Incorporating intersectionality is needed to address structural inequalities in sleep that reflect the lived social realities beyond the individual-level. Our sample consisted on 17,008 individuals aged 50 and older from waves 4 and 5 of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We created 72 unique intersectional strata by interacting individual axes of social inequality (sex/gender, family caregiving, education, occupation) with perceived neighborhood deprivation. To investigate the variations in sleep disturbances across intersectional strata, we employed Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA). Intersectional strata explained 8.48% of the variance in sleep disturbances, with the most vulnerable groups (i.e., women doing family caregiving, with low education, blue-collar occupations and living in highly-deprived neighborhoods) displaying the most sleep disturbances. Sex/gender and neighborhood deprivation were the main predictors of such differences. Although we found some multiplicative effects, most differences in sleep disturbances were driven by additive effects. Given the importance of sleep for health and the growing social inequalities, intersectionality is as a useful tool to map and decompose sleep disparities. Interventions should go beyond the individual-level and include measures at the neighborhood-level to promote sleep equity. Tailored prevention actions should target socially vulnerable groups, especially women living in deprived neighborhoods.
