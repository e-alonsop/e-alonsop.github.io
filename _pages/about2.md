I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Medical Sociology](https://medizinsoziologie-reha-wissenschaft.charite.de/en/) in Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. I am researching social determinants of health from an intersectional perspective. With that, I aim to understand how population heterogeneities affect health inequalities, especially new forms of family diversity.

My background is Health Economics with a specialization in statistical methods. In my research I focus on quantitative intersectionality to measure health inequalities, while also analyzing interactions between biological and social/environmental determinants of health. I am highly interested in the social epidemiology of sleep, aiming to unravel inequalities in sleep health accross diverse populations.

I am always happy to talk about current research or potential new endeavors. Whether you are looking for a collaboration or a chat about common interests, do not hesitate to contact or follow me!
