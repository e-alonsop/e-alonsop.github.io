## Einstein Center Population Diversity (ECPD)

The [Einstein Center Population Diversity](https://medizinsoziologie-reha-wissenschaft.charite.de/en/research/aging_research/einstein_center_population_diversity/) (ECPD) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research center based in Berlin. The main aim is to study the consequences of increasing population diversity for social inequality and health disparities by focusing on the growing diversity of families, including changing conceptions and boundaries of the family itself. 

Demographic changes such as growing longevity and increasing family diversity play key roles in shaping our current and future societies. While seen as an opportunity, diversity also entails potential risks of inequalities such as segregation, social exclusion, or disparities in health and education. It is necessary to cooperate in a consortium of research institutions, with an intersectional and interdisciplinary approach on how demographic and family diversity can affect critical dimensions of social and health inequality. Given the societal relevance of understanding the interrelations of family and population diversity in the key outcomes of education, economic welfare and health from a life course perspective, the ECPD pursues the following three overarching research ambitions:

1. To assess the implications of growing population and family diversity for social and health inequalities and to identify promising targets and approaches for intervention
2. To advance our understanding of social and health inequalities through the integration of biomedical and social science
3. To capture the social and health consequences of current and potential future global crises and changes for individuals, families and societies

The ECPD firmly establishes social demography in Berlin and Germany. It promotes a broader conceptual understanding of how health research, including aging, disability, mobility, and mortality as well as biological or epigenetic perspectives can enrich social science and vice versa. By linking the two strands of research, the ECPD overcomes disciplinary fragmentation and moves toward a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of how social and health inequalities are shaped through ongoing (mega)trends and their interaction with the family sphere, thus creating a scientific basis for tackling the paramount societal challenges ahead of us.
